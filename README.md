# Airport-Delay-Risk-Analytics-System

A Machine-Learning Powered System for Predicting Airport Delay Risk Using Weather + Operational Data

## 📌 Overview

ADRAS (Airport Delay Risk Analytics System) is a real-world, data-driven project that analyzes and predicts airport delay behavior by combining:

Airline delay causes (carrier, weather, NAS, late aircraft)

Daily weather measurements (wind, precipitation, temperature)

Engineered hybrid metrics (Weather Severity Score, Reliability Index, Delay Risk Score)

This project merges operations + meteorology to accurately estimate delay risk and provide powerful visual insights through ML models and professional-grade analytics.

## 🎯 Objectives

Analyze historical airline delay patterns

Identify key operational + weather contributors

Engineer advanced features for risk modeling

Build ML models to predict monthly delay risk

Visualize insights with visually appealing dashboards and plots

## Datasets:

Weather data from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/

Flight delay data from BTS TranStats Database https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ot_delay/ot_delaycause1.asp
